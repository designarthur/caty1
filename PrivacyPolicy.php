                    <h2 id="retention-data" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">3. Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">The duration for which CAT Dump retains Your Personal Data is determined by the specific purpose for which it was collected, our legal and regulatory obligations, and our legitimate business needs. We are committed to retaining Your data only for as long as is necessary and proportionate.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">Generally, we will retain Your Personal Data for the period necessary to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Provide and maintain our Service:</strong> This includes retaining data for the entire duration of Your active account with us, and for a reasonable period thereafter, to facilitate re-engagement, provide customer support, and maintain service continuity. For instance, rental history and invoice data are retained to allow you to review past transactions and reorder services with ease.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage Your Account:</strong> Data associated with Your account, such as Your profile information and preferences, is retained as long as Your account remains active to provide a personalized experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Comply with legal obligations:</strong> We are subject to various laws and regulations that require us to retain certain types of data for specific periods. This includes financial records, transaction histories, and communication logs for tax, audit, and compliance purposes.

                        <li><strong>Resolve disputes:</strong> In the event of a legal dispute or claim, we may retain relevant Personal Data for as long as necessary to resolve such disputes effectively.</li>

                        <li><strong>Prevent fraud and ensure security:</strong> Certain data may be retained to detect, prevent, and investigate fraudulent activities or security incidents, even after Your account is closed, to protect the integrity of our Service and other users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-6">The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data, being generally aggregated and anonymized, is typically retained for a shorter period of time compared to identifiable Personal Data. However, exceptions apply when this data is specifically used to strengthen the security of Our Service, to improve or troubleshoot the functionality of Our Service, or if We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods (e.g., for cybersecurity investigations). Once data is no longer required for these purposes, we implement procedures for its secure deletion or anonymization, ensuring it can no longer be associated with an identifiable individual.</p>

                    <h2 id="transfer-data" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">4. Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">CAT Dump operates in a global digital environment, which means that Your information, including Personal Data, may be processed and stored in locations outside of Your immediate geographical region. This section clarifies how Your data may be transferred and the safeguards we put in place to protect it.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">Your information, including Personal Data, is primarily processed at the Company's operating offices in Dallas, Texas, United States. However, it may also be processed in any other places where the parties involved in the data processing are located. This means that Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in Your jurisdiction. For instance, some of our Service Providers may operate data centers or support teams in different countries.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">By using our Service and submitting Your information, You explicitly consent to this transfer of Your Personal Data. We want to assure You that despite international transfers, our commitment to protecting Your data remains unwavering.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This means that no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place to ensure the security and protection of Your data and other personal information. These adequate controls may include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):</strong> Implementing data transfer agreements based on standard contractual clauses approved by relevant regulatory bodies (e.g., the European Commission), which impose strict obligations on the data importer to protect personal data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs):</strong> For transfers within our corporate group (including affiliates), we may rely on Binding Corporate Rules, which are internal codes of conduct approved by data protection authorities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Explicit Consent:</strong> In specific situations, and where no other legal basis for transfer applies, we may obtain Your explicit consent for the transfer after informing You of the possible risks of such transfers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adequacy Decisions:</strong> Relying on adequacy decisions by relevant authorities that confirm a particular country or framework provides an adequate level of data protection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-6">We continuously monitor the legal and regulatory landscape concerning international data transfers to ensure our practices remain compliant and Your data remains protected, regardless of where it is processed.</p>

                    <h2 id="disclosure-data" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">5. Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">While CAT Dump is committed to safeguarding Your Personal Data, there are specific circumstances under which Your information may be disclosed. This section outlines these situations, ensuring transparency regarding how and when Your data might be shared beyond the direct provision of our services.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">5.1 Business Transactions</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">In the event that the Company undergoes significant corporate changes, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or the sale of all or a portion of its assets, Your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. This is a standard practice in such business transitions. Should such an event occur, We will provide You with prominent notice prior to Your Personal Data being transferred. This notification will inform You about the impending transfer and, importantly, advise You if Your data will become subject to a different privacy policy by the acquiring entity. Our aim is to ensure You are fully aware of any changes to the handling of Your data in such scenarios.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">5.2 Law enforcement</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">Under certain circumstances, CAT Dump may be legally required to disclose Your Personal Data. This obligation arises when we receive a valid request from law enforcement authorities or other public bodies. Such requests typically come in the form of a court order, subpoena, or other legally binding governmental demand. We will only disclose the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary to comply with such legal obligations, and we will assess the legality and necessity of each request before proceeding. Our priority is to protect Your privacy while adhering to the rule of law.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">5.3 Other legal requirements</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">Beyond direct law enforcement requests, the Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to fulfill other critical legal or operational requirements. These situations include, but are not limited to, instances where disclosure is necessary to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Comply with a legal obligation:</strong> This covers a broad range of regulatory and statutory requirements, such as responding to discovery requests in litigation, adhering to industry-specific regulations, or fulfilling reporting obligations to governmental agencies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company:</strong> This includes situations where we need to take legal action to protect our intellectual property, enforce our terms of service, recover debts, or defend against legal claims brought against CAT Dump.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service:</strong> If we detect or suspect fraudulent activities, security breaches, or other violations of our policies or applicable laws, we may disclose relevant data to investigate and mitigate such issues. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of our platform for all users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public:</strong> In emergency situations where there is a credible threat to the physical safety of an individual or the public, we may disclose necessary Personal Data to prevent harm.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect against legal liability:</strong> This involves disclosing data as part of our efforts to manage legal risks, respond to legal claims, or comply with professional obligations (e.g., disclosures to our legal counsel or auditors).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="security-data" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">6. Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">The security of Your Personal Data is a top priority for CAT Dump. We are committed to implementing and maintaining robust security measures to protect Your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We employ a multi-layered approach to data security, integrating both technical and organizational safeguards.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">Our security measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We utilize industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) to protect data during transmission over the internet. This ensures that communications between Your device and our servers are secure and private. Where appropriate, data at rest (stored on our servers) is also encrypted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to Personal Data is strictly limited to authorized personnel who require the information to perform their job functions. We implement role-based access controls and the principle of least privilege, ensuring employees only have access to the data necessary for their specific tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure Servers and Infrastructure:</strong> Our data is hosted on secure servers within controlled environments, protected by firewalls and other network security technologies. We partner with reputable cloud infrastructure providers that adhere to high security standards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:</strong> We conduct regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and engage in penetration testing by independent third-party experts. These proactive measures help us identify and address potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited.</li>
                        <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> All employees who handle Personal Data undergo mandatory and regular training on data protection, privacy best practices, and our internal security policies. This ensures a culture of security awareness across the organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> We have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to detect, contain, investigate, and recover from any potential data security incidents. This plan includes procedures for timely notification to affected individuals and relevant authorities, as required by law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We adhere to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the Personal Data that is necessary for the stated purposes. This reduces the amount of sensitive information we hold.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Security Measures:</strong> Our physical facilities and data centers are protected by appropriate physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to hardware and data storage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> We encourage and, where applicable, require the use of multi-factor authentication for accessing Your account, adding an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-6">While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data and continuously review and update our security practices, it is important to remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while We endeavor to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage You to also take steps to protect Your personal information, such as using strong, unique passwords and being cautious about sharing information online.</p>

                    <h2 id="data-protection-rights" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">7. Your Data Protection Rights (e.g., CCPA)</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">At CAT Dump, we are committed to empowering You with control over Your Personal Data. In accordance with applicable data protection laws, You have certain fundamental rights regarding Your information. We are dedicated to honoring these rights and providing mechanisms for You to exercise them effectively.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">Your data protection rights may include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>The Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether or not Your Personal Data is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the Personal Data and certain information about its processing. You can request copies of Your Personal Data that We hold.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that We correct any information You believe is inaccurate or incomplete. If You identify any errors or omissions in Your Personal Data, please notify us, and we will take reasonable steps to rectify them promptly.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):</strong> You have the right to request that We erase Your Personal Data, under certain conditions. This right applies when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when You withdraw consent, among other specific legal grounds. Please note that certain legal obligations may require us to retain some data even after an erasure request.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that We restrict the processing of Your Personal Data, under certain conditions. This means that we would store Your data but not use it for specific processing activities, for example, if You contest the accuracy of the data or the legality of its processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You have the right to object to Our processing of Your Personal Data, under certain conditions, particularly when the processing is based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. We will cease processing Your data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override Your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request that We transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to You, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions. This allows You to obtain and reuse Your Personal Data for Your own purposes across different services.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where our processing of Your Personal Data is based on Your consent, You have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-6">For California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides specific additional rights concerning Your personal information. Under the CCPA, "personal information" is broadly defined to include information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Your CCPA rights include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to request that We disclose what personal information We collect, use, disclose, and sell (if applicable). This includes categories of personal information, sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling it, categories of third parties with whom we share it, and specific pieces of personal information collected about You.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of personal information that We have collected from You, subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we may not be able to delete information necessary to complete a transaction, detect security incidents, or comply with legal obligations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> You have the right to opt-out of the sale of Your personal information. As a fundamental principle, CAT Dump does not sell personal information to third parties. Therefore, this right applies in principle but is not actively exercised as we do not engage in such sales.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of Your CCPA rights. This means we will not deny You goods or services, charge You different prices, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services because You exercised Your rights.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-6">To exercise any of these data protection rights, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Us" section below. We will verify Your request and respond within the timeframes required by applicable law (e.g., typically 30 days for GDPR-related requests and 45 days for CCPA requests, with possible extensions). We may require You to provide additional information to verify Your identity before processing Your request.</p>

                    <h2 id="childrens-privacy" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">Protecting the privacy of young individuals is a critical aspect of our commitment to data protection. Our Service is not intended for, nor does it knowingly target, anyone under the age of 13 ("Children" or "Child").</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Our Service is designed for individuals involved in equipment rental and related services, which are typically adults or businesses.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">If You are a parent or guardian and You become aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data without Your verifiable consent, please contact Us immediately using the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy. We will take prompt steps to investigate the matter and, if confirmed, remove that information from Our servers and any associated databases.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">Furthermore, if We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information, and Your country or jurisdiction requires the consent of a parent or guardian for individuals below a certain age (e.g., 16 in some regions), We may require Your parent's or guardian's verifiable consent before We collect and use that information. This ensures compliance with international and regional child privacy regulations.</p>

                    <h2 id="links-to-other-websites" class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-6">9. Links to Other Websites</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">Our Service may contain links to external websites that are not operated by CAT Dump. These links are provided for Your convenience and to offer additional resources or information that may be relevant to Your needs. However, please be aware that once You click on a third-party link, You will be directed away from our Service to that third party's site.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service of every external site You visit. The privacy practices and content of these third-party websites are beyond our control. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by CAT Dump through our Service.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">This includes links to social media platforms, payment gateways, or other external tools that may be integrated into our Service. While we strive to partner with reputable organizations, we cannot be held responsible for their independent data collection or privacy practices. Your interactions with these linked websites are governed by their respective policies, not ours.</p>

We are committed to keeping our Privacy Policy current and transparent.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">We will notify You of any material changes by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this page. Minor changes or clarifications may be effective immediately upon posting. For significant updates that affect how we use or share Your Personal Data, we will provide more prominent notice.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">We will let You know via email (sent to the primary email address specified in Your account) and/or a prominent notice on Our Service (e.g., a banner on our website or a notification within the app), prior to the change becoming effective. This notification will also update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy, allowing You to quickly identify when the policy was last revised.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has been posted signifies Your acceptance of the changes. If You do not agree with the terms of the updated Privacy Policy, You should discontinue Your use of the Service.</p>
